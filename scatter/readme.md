## 1.implemetation
#### 1. get the .exe
* in virtual environment(If you have no Idea, refer to [this]())

#### 2. just run the code
* in virtual enviroment
``` 
cd ./scatter
./src/scatter.py
```
* since I wrote it in class form, you can simply import it
# 2. NOTE
1. first, you would have the .xlsx file (run setting.py to see the form)
2. then input data into the .xlsx(ex. test.xlsx)
3. run scatter.exe or run scatter.py to open GUI
4. drop file into the listbox
5. you can select/delete files you chosed(not a .xlsx will cause corruption, I didn't do that)
6. click enter button in GUI or just enter can plot scatter for selected filename(multiple is doable)
7. output file will be the same level with input file and name as < filename >_out.xlsx
